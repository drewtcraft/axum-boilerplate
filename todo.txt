TODO ("-" to do; "x" done)
--------------------------
- think through the data storage for rich text
	- it is JSON so ideally object storage
	- BUT it would be nice to attach it to each post in the query
- think through how to add Quill.js
	- native script that takes a callback and executes it after it has loaded Quill, if Quill is unloaded
	- another native script which is used to attach quill data to the enclosing form element
	- per-template script that calls native method and injects Quill data in the callback to render
	- per-template script removes itself (self-destruct!)

x rewrite Post model and rename to PostModel
X rewrite PostModel::create_post query
	X use query builder to handle if there's no thread_id
X rewrite create_thread/post handler and template
X rewrite PostModel::get_posts
